# CodeBreaker
A mastermind like game.  still a work in progress.
# Rules and instructions
You have the option of three different difficulties. These include Newbie, Hacker, and Cryptographer.  This is done through an input and if statement. \n
NEWBIE \n 
You have 10 tries to get a 4 digit code.  This is done through a while loop that iterates until you get the code or you use up all 10 tries. \n 
The code is made up of 0, 1, 2 , 3 ,4.  This is randomly generated using a randint for the generation of the code.
If you get the code before the 10 tries are up then you will get a message congratulating you on getting it.  This will break the while loop. \n
HACKER \n   
You have 10 tries to get a 4 digit code. This is done through a while loop that iterates until get the code or use up all 10 tries.  
The code is made up of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  This is randomly generated using a randint for the generation of the code.\n
If you get the code before the 10 tries are up then you will get a message congratulating you on getting it.  This will end that game and break the while loop.\n
CRYPT\n
You have 15 tries to get a 5 digit code. This is done through a while loop that iterates until get the code or use up all 15 tries. 
The code is made up of 0 - 20. This is randomly generated using a randint for the generation of the code.\n
If you get the code before the 15 tries are up then you will get a message congratulating you on getting it. This will end the game and break the while loop.\n
There is also a story mode under development. This will consist of 20 levels that get progressively harder.
